# BridgeDAO
BrdigeDAO is a general implementation of a concept of [Collateralized DAO Proxy Services](https://research.aragon.org/t/collateralized-dao-proxy-services-as-an-aragon-network-use-case/137) with purpose of bridging the gap between the phyisical world and DAOs. Its first specific implementation, called Paperclip, solves the problem of DAOs being unable to receive, hold and send fiat transactions in a trustless way.
Further introduction is available in Aragon Nest Proposal.
